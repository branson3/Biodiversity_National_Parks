# Biodiversity_National_Parks
In this analysis, we look at observation data from a seven day period at four national parks; Yellowstone National Park, Yosemite National Park, Bryce National Park and Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  We will look into what species are observed in these parks, and at what frequency, to determine which parks may have the most diversity.
We find that for all of the metrics we use in our analysis, Yellowstone has the greatest diversity, Yosemite has the second greatest diversity, Bryce has the third greatest and Great Smoky Mountains has the least.
